NightlyNmap
===========

Code based on my [blog post](http://code-read.blogspot.com/2011/06/nightly-nmap-scans-with-ndiff.html)
for performing scheduled scans of a network and noting differences. Read the post
for details on how it works and how to install.

Known issues
------------

Upstream [Ndiff](http://nmap.org/ndiff/) has changed, so this won't work
with the latest version.
